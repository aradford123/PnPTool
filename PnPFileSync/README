FileSync utility keeps an external directory of PNP config, image and template files synced to APIC-EM

It requires python3 for the uniq library.

Also recommend using virtualenv.  Use the following commands as examples


virtualenv -p python3 env
source env/bin/activate

To install:
pip install -r requirements.txt

You will need to edit the apic_config.py file to change your credentials.

You will also need a directory that has (up to three subdirectories).

For example if your PnP directory is called pnp_files, you would have the following structure
pnp_files/
    ├── config/
    ├── image/
    ├── template/

Place config files in pnp_files/config, template files in pnp_files/template etc.

Use src/file_sync.py to check if a file exists on the controller, update it if it does, or upload it if it is not present


To run:
src/file_sync.py
