There are several tools in this directory for PnP server running in APIC-EM

PnPConfigTemplator: example scripts using jinja2 templates.
The templates are hierachical.  There is a base template, then a template for a 1-2-3 switch stack is built based on the base.
Shows a lot of the power of jinja2; loops, blocks etc

PnPFileSync: keeps config, template and images files in sync with controller.  User can edit config files off box, then sync to APIC-EM
